# FaceONNX
**FaceONNX** is a face analytics library based on [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) runtime. It containts ready-made deep neural networks for face
* detection and landmarks extraction,
* gender and age classification,
* emotion and beauty classification,
* embeddings comparison and etc.  
  
**FaceONNX** is basically focused on [C#](netstandard), but it has [Python](python) implementation.
